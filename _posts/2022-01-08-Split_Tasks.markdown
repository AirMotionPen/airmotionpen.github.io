# Split Tasks
- Collect more data (other participants)
- Obtain gesture recognition model, check Teensy functionality for running models (Larry)
- Search for more available components and verify compatibility(Angela, Simon):
  - Make sure our selected components are smaller than our microprocessor Teensy, and if those aren’t, select another replacement. We haven’t checked the connection compatibility and we don’t know how each component will work. We need to verify the connection of those components with Teensy and know how each component works. Get the link to purchase for each component and get ready to buy them.
